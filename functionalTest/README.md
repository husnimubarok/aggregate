# Functional tests submodule

This directory holds code that tests Aggregate through its web client and APIs. 

## Depcrecation notice

This should/will probably be replaced by:

 - Unit & integration tests in `common` submodule
 - An external [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) (or similar) suite.
